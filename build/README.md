This directory pins the native runtime inputs used by the containerd/nerdbox
adapter. The manifest is authoritative; the patches are checked by the
`internal/manifest` test.

## Components

- containerd `2.4.2`

  `manifest.yaml`
- default image `docker.io/library/alpine:3.22` at the pinned digest

## Patches

The gvproxy patch is experimental until matching integration and security
tests are recorded in the plan:

- `patches/gvproxy-egress-policy-v2.patch` — default-deny egress policy,
  domain-aware DNS authorization with a bounded resolved-IP cache, revision
  reload, audit, flow revocation, bearer authentication on the host services
  API, and the supervisor owner lease. The daemon
  requires the patched `-require-owner-lease` option; older gvproxy builds are
  rejected at startup. Domain-only TCP authorization additionally requires a
  bounded TLS ClientHello with a matching SNI and DNS binding. Policy DNS A/AAAA
  lookups use the configured upstream, retry truncated UDP replies over TCP to
  that upstream, follow bounded CNAME chains and expire bindings at the minimum
  observed TTL. Encrypted Client Hello on the
  domain-only path, domain-only UDP, and domain denies overlapping a direct IP
  allow are rejected. Policy decisions, audit records, and flow tracking use
  the guest-visible destination evaluated before host NAT translation.
  Candidate IPv6 support (`stack.ipv6Enabled`, guest ULA/RA, AAAA policy
  lookups, IPv6 CIDR matching, TCP SNI binding to v6 addresses, explicit
  IPv6 host-services NAT entries, and `guest-ipv6:` loopback publish targets)
  and candidate QUIC v1/v2
  classification (Initial parsing, SNI extraction, domain UDP policy, and
  fail-closed handling of Retry, 0-RTT, coalesced packets and ECH) are present
  in this patch but are not public capabilities: the gateway only renders
  `ipv6Enabled`, the IPv6 host-services NAT entry, and `guest-ipv6:` behind
  its disabled experimental flag, and
  the control plane still rejects UDP domain rules. The IPv6 datapath enables
  forwarding on the single guest NIC so NDP Neighbor Advertisements for the
  advertised router carry the Router flag; otherwise Linux demotes `fe80::1`
  when it resolves the router and deletes the RA default route until the next
  advertisement. Router Advertisements include the Source Link-Layer Address
  option, are sent every 10s with a 30s router lifetime, and answer Router
  Solicitations immediately. The raw ICMPv6 listener binds to the NIC rather
  than to `fe80::1` so solicitations sent to `ff02::2` are received. Live VM
  evidence includes ULA/RA assignment, a host `[::1]` publish probe, and a
  three-minute IPv6 host-services egress run without a static route; the routed
  AAAA/SNI allow/deny matrix, two-VM tests, and QUIC live handshakes remain
  open.
  Live VM evidence (2026-11-01): default deny, allowed domain fetch with a
  matching SNI, direct-IP connection without a matching name denied
  (`tls-name-denied`), non-TLS on a domain-only rule denied, DNS refusal
  after rule revocation, and reload revocation of active flows. HTTP Host
  and complete DNS-rebinding and bypass guarantees are not established; the
  patch remains experimental.
- `patches/nerdbox-gpt-threshold.patch` — raises nerdbox's GPT threshold from
  8 to 128 layers so multi-layer images stay on raw virtio EROFS disks instead
  of the GPT VMDK path that libkrun 1.19.6 rejects. Build the shim with
  `scripts/build-nerdbox-shim.sh`; the hypervisor entitlement is mandatory.
- `patches/qemu-windows-private-pipe-v1.patch` — on Windows, uses the
  `RHEIC_PIPE_SDDL` supplied by the runtime to create QEMU's virtio-serial
  named pipe with a protected current-user + SYSTEM DACL and rejects remote
  pipe clients. The host validates the resulting pipe ACL before returning a
  stream. Stock QEMU's Windows pipe backend passes a null security descriptor;
  this runtime therefore refuses to use an unpatched binary. This patch is
  experimental and has not been built or exercised on Windows.

Nested Docker Engine remains blocked. The former nerdbox cgroup/capability
patch was removed because it applied broad capabilities and a writable bind of
the whole guest cgroup filesystem to every workload. Do not reintroduce it without an explicit
opt-in profile, least-privilege capability analysis, and guest-only cgroup
design validated against the pinned nerdbox build.

Patch SHA-256 values are recorded in `manifest.yaml` and checked by the
manifest test.

## Build outline

When producing the Linux guest EROFS image on macOS, specify a 4096-byte
block size explicitly. The macOS `mkfs.erofs` default can use 16384-byte
blocks, which the pinned guest kernel rejects during boot:

```sh
mkfs.erofs -b4096 -zlz4 /path/to/nerdbox-rootfs.erofs /path/to/guest-rootfs
```

The guest root filesystem must contain the vminitd built from the pinned
unmodified source. Do not use the removed broad cgroup/capability patch.

```sh
# gvproxy
git clone https://github.com/containers/gvisor-tap-vsock
cd gvisor-tap-vsock
git checkout 0b0819c174331f5b86d96db3ab7aad7dd126078e
git apply /path/to/build/patches/gvproxy-egress-policy-v2.patch
go build -o gvproxy-policy-v2 ./cmd/gvproxy
```

or use `scripts/build-gvproxy.sh` with `GVPROXY_SRC` and `OUT`.

The containerd process must find the patched shim on PATH before the stock
`containerd-shim-nerdbox-v1`; Rheic does not modify an existing containerd
installation. `scripts/build-nerdbox-shim.sh` builds and signs it.

Both native build scripts verify the source checkout's exact manifest commit
and reject tracked changes, untracked files, and ignored files before applying
patches. Go builds use `-trimpath`, disable VCS stamping, and clear the Go
build ID so independent build directories do not affect the unsigned payload
digest. On macOS/arm64, the nerdbox shim is ad-hoc signed for local execution;
that signature is not a release signature or provenance statement. On
Linux/arm64, `scripts/build-nerdbox-shim.sh` requires an explicit
`LIBKRUN_PREFIX` and links against its `libkrun` headers/library without macOS
codesigning. The loader must also find the matching `libkrun` and `libkrunfw`
shared libraries at runtime. The runtime adapter must consume these artifacts
from explicit paths; it must not download `@latest` components during a
reproducible build.

The Linux source build recipe is `scripts/build-libkrun-linux.sh`. It checks
the manifest-pinned libkrun/libkrunfw commits, the Linux kernel archive digest,
Rust `1.90.0`, and GCC `13.3.0`, then writes the built library hashes into the
prefix. Set `LIBKRUN_PREFIX` to an empty absolute directory; the script refuses
to overwrite a non-empty prefix. Source checkouts are always cloned into
temporary build trees and removed after the build.
`scripts/verify-libkrun-linux-prefix.sh` detects
post-build file drift against that prefix metadata. Since the metadata is
stored beside the libraries and is not signed, this check is not an
independent provenance or adversarial tamper guarantee.

This recipe pins source identities but does not yet claim bit-for-bit
reproducibility: the complete build image, compiler/linker and system package
set are not digest-pinned, and the produced library hashes are not compared to
an independently published expected digest. Tagged release builds still need
CI provenance/signing and verification of the exact shared library loaded at
runtime. The nerdbox v0.2.5 Docker recipe builds libkrun v1.19.0 and mutates
its `imago` Cargo dependency, so it does not validate this manifest's libkrun
v1.19.6 selection.

The project shim recipe also applies a small compatibility patch that treats
`krun_get_shutdown_eventfd` as optional outside macOS. libkrun v1.19.6 only
exports that symbol on macOS/aarch64, while the pinned nerdbox loader otherwise
requires every declared symbol during Linux library loading. Linux never calls
this function in the pinned source. Keep the patch and its manifest digest in
sync, and retain a Linux runtime regression proving the library loads and a
KVM task can boot.

The Windows branch follows Docker's documented platform contract (Windows 11
x64 with Windows Hypervisor Platform), while using QEMU WHPX as the open VMM.
QEMU's Windows build must be produced from the pinned `qemu-windows` source,
with the private-pipe patch applied, using the documented MSYS2/MinGW build
environment. The QEMU source archive is signed upstream; verify its signature
and the pinned SHA-512 before applying the patch. The native Windows build
recipe and signed release artifacts are still outstanding; do not substitute
an unpatched system QEMU binary.
